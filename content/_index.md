:alien: my name's alexa and i'm a technical writer. 

i help developers build better apps. i'm a big fan of docs-as-code, chatting with engineers, and answering elusive grammar questions.  if i'm not staring at vs code, you might find me behind a drum kit or chasing my two cats off the counter. :kissing_cat:
