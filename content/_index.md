I'm a technical writer who's a big fan of docs-as-code. I spend my days writing about system performance and data so your devs can build better apps. 

While I'm a docs writer first, I can also improve your UI copy, manage EOL comms, and whip up some GTM materials, too. Before reading through my portfolio, I recommend taking a look at my [portfolio notes](/docs/) so you can get some insight about tooling and each doc's intended audiences. :alien:
