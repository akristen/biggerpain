:alien: i'm a technical writer who loves docs-as-code.  i spend my days writing about system performance and data so your devs can build better apps. 

i have plenty of experience writing all kinds of docs, but i can also improve your UI copy, manage EOL comms, and whip up some GTM materials, too. i recommend first reading my [portfolio notes](/docs/) so you can get some insight about tooling and intended audience.
