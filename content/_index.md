my name's alexa and i'm a technical writer.  :alien:

i've spent the last three years helping developers build better apps. i'm a big fan of docs-as-code, chatting with engineers, and editing (or deleting) stale docs content. 

if i'm not staring at vs code, you might find me behind a drum kit or chasing my two cats off the counter. :kissing_cat: my site is under construction, so i've applied the first rule of docs writing: publish now and fix later.
