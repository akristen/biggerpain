my name's alexa and i'm a technical writer.  :alien:

i've spent the last three years helping developers build better apps. i'm a big fan of docs-as-code, chatting with engineers, and editing (or deleting) stale docs content. 

if i'm not furiously writing in vs code, you might find me behind a drum kit or making funny faces at my cats. :kissing_cat:
