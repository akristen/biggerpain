:alien: my name's alexa and i'm a technical writer. 

i've spent the last three years helping developers build better apps. i'm a big fan of docs-as-code, chatting with engineers, and answering elusive grammar questions.  

if i'm not staring at vs code, you might find me behind a drum kit or chasing my two cats off the counter. :kissing_cat: my site is still under construction!
